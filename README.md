# Event Sink Problem

## Overview

This is just a simple event sink between a fake socket and database using Python.

## Prerequisites

This was developed with Python 3.7.16. No dependencies should be necessary.

## Execution

Run the script with the following:

```
python src/eventsink.py
```

Stopping the script can be done with ctrl+c, but it might take a few seconds for everything to gracefully shut down. The shutdown procedure isn't fancy or anything.
